The AI engineer has progressed significantly in developing the Zomato-like travel aggregator app, now rebranded SponsoredTrip. Initial work focused on clarifying requirements and establishing a robust full-stack (React Native Expo, FastAPI, MongoDB) foundation, including JWT authentication. The first major feature implemented was a complex Budget Travel backend algorithm, which involved new models, API endpoints, and utilizing a provided JSON for location proximity. This was followed by a complete UI/UX overhaul to match the SponsoredTrip branding, incorporating a new logo, theme, and shared UI components.

Throughout the process, the AI engineer addressed several critical frontend rendering bugs related to sticky headers and syntax errors, particularly in  and , requiring multiple refactors. Backend sample data generation was enhanced to support diverse agents and packages, including subscription statuses and sponsored pricing. Recent efforts have centered on implementing advanced filter options, chat functionality for subscribed vendors, and refining the Budget Travel frontend display, responding directly to continuous user feedback and bug reports.

The objective is to build SponsoredTrip, a mobile travel application mirroring Zomato's interface for Travel Agents and Transport Agents, using React Native (Expo), FastAPI, and MongoDB. The application features JWT authentication and a home screen with a search bar, dynamic filter ribbons, Recommended For You, and Explore More sections, populated from the database. Agent listings are filterable by type, with a details page for individual agents and their packages.

New features include:
1.  **Budget Travel**: A section under Explore More allowing users to input budget, number of persons, days, and an optional place. The system curates and groups travel packages (potentially from multiple vendors, including transport) based on these criteria, with groups clickable to reveal details.
2.  **Advanced Filter**: An All filter dropdown opening a sub-window with advanced options (Sort by: relevance, rating, cost; Time: schedule via calendar; Rating: 3.0*+, 4.0*+; Sponsored: up to 30%, >50%).
3.  **Sponsored Listings**: Agents with discounted sponsored prices should appear under a Sponsored filter, displaying the original price as cut-through.
4.  **Subscription-based Vendors & Chat**: Subscribed vendors appear in the Recommended For You section and offer a chat option with each package listing, opening a chat window with history and saving messages to the database.

The UI must adhere to the SponsoredTrip brand, featuring a light sky blue theme, shadow effects, and card-based designs, with ample sample data for testing.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing three critical user-reported issues:
1.  **Sponsored Filter Issue**: The filter was not displaying any agents. The AI has initiated a fix by updating the backend logic in  to correctly identify and serve sponsored agents, which is currently an ongoing backend refinement.
2.  **Missing Chat Option**: The chat option was absent from subscribed vendors' package listings. The AI has created the  component and is actively integrating it into the  screen. The goal is to add message buttons to each package and enable the modal for chat interactions.
3.  **All Filter/Advanced Filter UI**: The All filter option is not yet a functional dropdown, and the  is not opening as intended. This frontend UI integration is pending, as the focus is currently on the chat implementation.

The immediate work involves modifying  to incorporate the chat functionality.
